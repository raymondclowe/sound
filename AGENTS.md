- YOU HAVE AMNESIA! CHECK YOUR MEMORIES!
- Be brief, use bullet points instead of paragraphs
- Be precise, only change what needs to be changed
- Don't be lazy, just keep working, when the choices are obvious just go ahead
- Create a .private folder with a MY-MEMORIES.md to save your memories and add to them as you go along so you can defeat your amnesia
- Make good use of git, to small atomic well described commits
- Save your learnings (solutions to problems where you tried multiple ways before getting it right) into .private\LEARNINGS.md and reference that when you have problems in future
